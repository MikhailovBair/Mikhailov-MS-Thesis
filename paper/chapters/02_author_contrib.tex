\chapter{Author contribution}
This work represents an end-to-end computational study conducted solely by the author. Key contributions include:  

\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{Research Design}:   
    - Designed the hybrid ML pipeline (U-Net segmentation $\rightarrow$ ResNet classification $\rightarrow$ Grad-CAM interpretation).  

    \item \textbf{Data Curation}:  
    - Preprocessed CT scans from SPbSU Department of Vertebrate zoology.  

    \item \textbf{Interpretation}:  
    - Linked ML results to evolutionary biology, concluding tomistomas share neuroanatomical traits with crocodiles.  
    - Critically addressed limitations.  

    \item \textbf{Manuscript Preparation}:  
    - Wrote the manuscript, generated all figures/tables, and synthesized comparative literature.  
\end{itemize}
